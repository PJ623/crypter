Crypter
===


Crypter is a Node.js app that encrypts and decrypts files that are saved in the app's `collection` folder.

To decrypt files, simply run the app and input a correct password. If you are running the app for the first time, you will be asked to create your own password.

To encrypt files, close the app either by closting the terminal with `CTRL-C` or by submitting a specific close phrase (phrases such as "quit", "stop", "q", or "gg") into the Node.js terminal.
